    "description": "The F1x4 model describes codon frequencies in terms of 4 nucleotide frequencies.  Considering a transition from a codon ijk to a codon ilk the F1x4 model considers the frequencies of all nucleotides in the target codon:\n   R(ijk,ilk) = pi[i]*pi[l]*pi[k],\nso that substitution happens at a slower rate at nucleotides that are adjacent to a low-frequency nucleotide.\nThe MG94 mode, on the other hand, considers only the frequency of l (the nucleotide that changed):\n   R(ijk,ilk) = pi[l].\nThus the rate of substitution does not depend on neighboring nucleotides i and k."
