    "description": "The MG94 model describes codon frequencies in terms of 4 nucleotide frequencies.  Considering a transition from a codon ijk to a codon ilk the MG94 model considers only the frequency of l (the nucleotide that changed):\n   R(ijk,ilk) = pi[l].\nThus the rate of substitution does not depend on neighboring nucleotides i and k.  For F1x4, on the other hand\n   R(ijk,ilk) = pi[i]*pi[l]*pi[k],\nso that substitution happens at a slower rate at nucleotides that are adjacent to a low-frequency nucleotide."
