BAli-Phy will translate this internally into RCTMC[S,R].\n\nIn the traditional '+F' model, R(i,j) = pi(j) so that\n   Q(i,j)=S(i,j)*pi(j).\nHowever other approaches are possible.  For codon models, we might want to use the frequency of individual nucleotides instead of the frequency of the codon, for example.",
