    - Add new syntax function[x,...] for specifying models.
    - new functions map, zip, zipWith.
    - m1a,m2a,..,m8a_test,branch-site, etc. now take functions as arguments.
    - let-bind names for lambda-dependent arguments, but inside the lambda.
  - Model framework
    - +fe as synonym for +f[Frequencies.uniform]
    - +f and +gwF now take exchange models like wag as a submodel.
    - logging now returns an object that can change shape dynamically.
    - function calls can now look like f[g[x],y] instead of just f[x,y]
    - arguments now referenced with @arg to fix function[x,add[x,x]]
    - fixes to unification and constraints.
