Install
-------

If you just want to install bali-phy, please visit the [release page](http://www.bali-phy.org/download.php).  If you want to compile BAli-phy from source, the quick start instructions are below.

Compiling
---------

You will need a C++ compiler that understands C++20.
 * gcc 10 (or higher) works
 * clang 13 (or higher) works
 * XCode 14 (or higher) works

Install Prerequisites
---------------------
On Ubuntu, you can use apt-get:
```bash
sudo apt-get install g++ libcairo2-dev meson libboost-all-dev
```

On Mac (or Linux, actually) you can use homebrew:
```bash
brew install cairo meson boost pkg-config
```

On miniconda, you can use:
```
conda create -n devel -c conda-forge --strict-channel-priority
conda activate devel
conda install meson gxx boost-cpp cmake pkg-config cairo
export BOOST_ROOT=$CONDA_PREFIX
```

### Meson version

After installing prerequisites above, check that the meson version is at least 1.1.

    meson --version

If your version of meson is less than 1.1, you need to install the most recent version of meson into a python virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv meson_venv
    source meson_venv/bin/activate
    pip install meson ninja


Build BAli-Phy
--------------

This will build the latest unreleased beta version of BAli-Phy, which fixes some memory issues in 3.6.  There are some changes to the model language.  Check the NEWS file for the details.

```
git clone https://github.com/bredelings/BAli-Phy.git
cd BAli-Phy
meson setup build --prefix=$HOME/Applications/bali-phy
ninja -C build install
ninja -C build test
```
