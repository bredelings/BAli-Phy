This benchmark is based on the amino-acid sequences of 69 RNA Polymerase alpha
subunits from legume genomes. The sequences are a mix of nuclear and plastid
genes, and the alignment is difficult because the plastid genes are
out-paralogs having diverged before the first plants.

The sequences were aligned with MAFFT using the slower -linsi option.  The
initial alignment is seriously over-aligned between nuclear and plastid 
genes.  Running BAli-Phy results in overall alignment getting bigger by
about 50% as the plastid genes get much bigger indel regions.
