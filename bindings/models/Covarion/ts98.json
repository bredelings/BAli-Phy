    "description": "The Tuffley-Steel covarion model splits every state into an ON and an OFF version, increasing the number of states by a factor of 2.  Rates for the ON version are given by the rate matrix Q of the submodel, while rates for the OFF version are 0:\n\n   rate ( (ON , state1) -> (ON , state2) ) = Q(state1, state2)\n   rate ( (OFF, state1) -> (OFF, state2) ) = 0\n\nRates for switching between ON and OFF are given by the s01 and s10 parameters, and are independent of the submodel state.\n\n   rate ( (ON , state ) -> (OFF, state ) ) = s10\n   rate ( (OFF, state ) -> (ON , state ) ) = s01\n\nRates for changing the level (ON,OFF) and the state at the same time are 0.\n\nWe parameterize s01 and s10 by:\n\n    pi1 = s01/(s10 + s01)\n    r   = s01 + s01,\nwhere pi1 is the fraction of time spent in the ON state.  The total rate of switching between states is:\n    rate = 2*r*pi1*(1-pi1)\n\nThe priors avoid placing too much mass on boundary conditions where this model reduces to a simpler model.",
