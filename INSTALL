This file briefly explains how to compile bali-phy.

See doc/README.html for full instructions with much more helpful detail.

---- Compiling from GIT source ----

This step is ONLY necessary if you are using the GIT source
(which you probably are not).  Distributed tarballs of the source
should include the files that this step generates.  

You need automake 1.8 or higher and autoconf 2.59 or higher to
generate these files.

% autoheader
% aclocal -I m4
% libtoolize
% automake -a
% autoconf

These commands generate the configure script and Makefiles.

--- Ultra Quick Version ---

% tar -zxf bali-phy-<version>.tgz      # Extract/uncompress the archive
                                          to create the source directory.

% mkdir bali-phy-<version>-build       # Make a SEPARATE build directory.

% cd bali-phy-<version>-build          # Enter the build directory.

% ../bali-phy-<version>/configure      # Run the configure script 
                                       #  from the source directory.

% make                                 # Build the software.

% make install                         # Install to /usr/local

Installed locations:
 /usr/local/bin                      - Binary executables.
 /usr/local/share/bali-phy/examples  - Example files.
 /usr/local/share/bali-phy/Data      - Data directory.
 /usr/local/share/doc/bali-phy/      - Documentation.

------ More options ------

If you wish to install it under <prefix> instead of under 
 /usr/local, then supply the flag --prefix=<prefix> to the configure
 script. For example, to install it in your home directory under
 ~/local, specify:

% ../bali-phy-<version>/configure --prefix=$HOME/local 

Extra options to configure can be revealed by supplying the --help
flag.
