{-
The problem with this is that setting
  type LogValue TreeLogger = forall t.(WriteNewickNode (Rooted t)) => t
doesn't work because we can't unify this with something.

Possibly this could be fixed by using this as an expected type and checking the type that
should match, instead of unifying.
-}

{-
   Ideally we could initialize a logger to get something with (i) an append operation and (ii) a finalize/close operation.
   Then we wouldn't have to perform IO just to define the logger.
   We only know what the operation is after we initialize the logger, because initializing creates the filehandle that we would write to.
