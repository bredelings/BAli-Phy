{-
We need the non-RanOp constructors because they behave differently in the different interpreters.
- RanOp: does the same thing in all interpreters.
- RanBind: adds unsafeInterleaveIO in the lazy interpreters, but not the strict ones.
- Lazy: doesn't just add unsafeInterleaveIO --> also forwards to a different interpreter.
- WithTKEffect: ignores the effect in the simple interpreters, runs the effect in the MCMC interpreters.
- PerformTKEffect: runs the effect at rate 1.0 in the simple interpreters, but at rate `rate` in the MCMC interpreters.
- RanDistribution2 just runs sampleIO in the simple interpreters, but creates a modifiable that runs sampleIO in the MCMC interpreters.
- RanDistribution3 just runs the sampling action in the simple interpreters, but creates a random structure and
   runs the associate tk_effects in the mcmc interpreter.
- RanSamplingRate: does nothing in the simple interpreters, but affects the rate of TKs in the MCMC interpreters
- RanInterchangeable: errors out in the strict interpeters, does nothing in the lazy simple interpreter, and
  creates an interchangable random dist in the lazy MCMC interpreter.

{- Note: sampleEffectProbs is NEARLY the same as observe.

Differences include:
* observe starts with liftIO .. this allows it to run in the Random monad.
* observe uses register_likelihood vs register_prior
* observe user register_dist_observe vs register_dist_sample
* observe does NOT run tk_effects

We could actually factor out the common parts if we could pass a constant SampleType = Sample | Observe

{- This runs as a SEQUENCE of operations in the IO monad.
 - The sequence can in theory be changeable, if it depends (for example) on the number of density terms.

   appears to have a changeable list of density terms.

{- NOTE: Problems with lists of probability factors.

In order to determine whether a PDF term corresponds to a newly sampled variable,
we check if the term has been newly registered.  However, if the list of factors
is itself changeable  (as in the coalescent pdf which does an internal sort), we
can end up registering new terms (I think), which are then ignored in the ratio
(I think).

An alternative would be to look not at the individual terms, but at the
distribution identifier created in `s <- register_dist_*`.  This shouldn't get
invalidated if the PDF terms change.

However, this leaves the question of what to do if the coalescent tree itself
changes dimension.
