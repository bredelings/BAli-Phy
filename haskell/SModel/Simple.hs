 * So arguably getAlphabet + stateLetters is really part of the observation model.
 *  - arguably, because the markov chains on internal states could perhaps be describes by an alphabet as well...
 *    but just for naming purposes?

 * We could in theory allow different mixture components to have different observation models.
   - getAlphabet / stateLetters

 * It should still make sense to have weighted componentFrequencies, but the rows of the weighted frequency MATRIX
   would have different lengths.  So maybe, weighted_frequenced_vectors: m -> EVector EVector Double.
