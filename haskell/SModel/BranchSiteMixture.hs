{- How should we scale the rate matrices?
   All Q matrices should be scaled by the same amount.

   The BUSTED paper does not specify a rescaling factor for the Q matrices.
   However, it says that branch lengths are fixed after optimization under a GTR model.
   Thus it makes sense to define the average rate to be 1.

   Currently (Dec 2024) phyloCTMC sets the average rate to be 1, so we do not need to
     divide by the model rate in branchTransitionP.

{-
  If there is a single model, then the reversibility and stationarity are the same as the single model.
  If we claim that all the models have the same equilibrium then the total is EqRev if all of them are, and EqNonRev, if all of them are, and NonEq otherwise.
  If any of the models is NonEq, then this is NonEq.

  The starting frequencies for this model should be the weighted average of the starting frequencies for the individual models.
  If they are all at equilibrium, and the equilibriums are all the same, then that's just the starting frequency for one model.
