-- Question: in the machine, can we change (x `seq` y `seq` z `seq` ()) to a node that forces x+y+z and evaluates to ()?
-- If y then becomes unreferenced, then this is a win.
-- If we modify each link in the linear chain instead of collapsing the whole chain, then maybe this is a fail?
-- Hmm... we could perform this cleanup if-and-only-if
-- * the reg is an index-var-with-force
-- * the reg is not referenced only by an index-var-with-force
-- * the called reg IS referenced only by an index-var-with-force
