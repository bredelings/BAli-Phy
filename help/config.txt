The --config command:

-c       <file>                              Config file to read.
--config <file>

Read command-line options from <file>.  This can be useful for
recording the options used in an analysis and re-running analyses.

Each option "--command=value" is given on its own line using the
syntax "command = value".  If the option does not take a value then
write just "command =".

Comments begin with '#', and blank lines are allowed.  Sequence
data is specified using the command "align".

Example file:

 # Compute probability and exit.
 test =

 # Sequence data for the three partitions.
 align = ITS1.fasta
 align = 5.8S.fasta
 align = ITS2.fasta

 # Link the first and third partition's smodel.
 smodel = 1,3:TN+DP[n=3]

 # The second partition has a fixed alignment.
 smodel = 2:TN
 imodel = 2:none

 # Link the first and third partition's scale.
 scale = 1,3:
