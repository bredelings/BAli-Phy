The --scale command:

-R      [partitions:]prior                  Prior on the Scale.
--scale [partitions:]prior

The default scale prior is "~Gamma[0.5,2]".

The branch lengths of the tree in each partition consist of
the shared branch lengths multiplied by a partition-specific
scaling factor.  Estimating this scale factor allows
estimating the evolutionary rate for the partition.

If no partitions are specified, then every partition gets a separate
scale.

If partitions are specified, then the partitions have linked scales.
That is, they share not just the same distribution on the scale, but
the same scale.

If the scale is specified as a constant, such as "--scale=1", then
the scale will not be estimated.

Examples:
   -R ~Gamma[0.5,2]
   --scale=~Gamma[0.5,2]
   -R 1
   --scale=1
