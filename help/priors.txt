Specifying priors:

Priors on model parameters are specified by giving a random value.
Random values can be obtained from distributions using the function
"Sample".  For example, this places a log-normal prior on kappa:
   HKY[kappa=Sample[logNormal[1,1]]]
You can write "~Dist" as a shorthand for "Sample[Dist]":
   HKY[kappa=~logNormal[1,1]]
The "=~" can be further shortened to just "~":
   HKY[kappa~logNormal[1,1]]

It also is possible to use random values as inputs to other functions:
   Add[1,~Exponential[10]]
In these cases, we use "=" to set the parameter value:
   RS07[meanIndelLength=Add[1,~Exponential[10]]]

Random values and distributions are of different types.  Thus the
following is of type "Distribution[Double]":
   Uniform[0,1]
In contrast, the following are both of type "Double":
   Sample[Uniform[0,1]]
   ~Uniform[0,1]
This is important when passing distributions as arguments to other
distributions and functions.  Thus, this works:
   iid[4,Normal[0,1]]
But, this is incorrect:
   iid[4,~Normal[0,1]]
