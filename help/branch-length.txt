The --branch-length command:

-B              prior                       Prior on branch-lengths.
--branch-length prior

Specifies the prior for branch lengths of the common tree, before
partition-specific scale factors are applied. The tree can be
referenced as the variable T.

The default branch-length prior is "~Gamma[0.5,Div[2,num_branches[T]]]".
Since the expected total tree length is 1 under this prior, the
expected tree length for each partition is given by the scale factor.

Examples:
   -B ~Gamma[0.5,Div[2,num_branches[T]]]
   --branch-length ~Exponential[Div[1,num_branches[T]]]
