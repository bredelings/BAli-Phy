The --iterations command:

-i           <number>                       Number of MCMC iterations.
--iterations <number>

BAli-Phy resamples every parameter and every pairwise alignment
during each iteration, as well as perform an NNI topology
proposal across each internal branch.  Iteration numbers in
BAli-Phy may therefore be lower other software which changes
only one parameter per iteration.

BAli-phy doesn't use a stopping rule, so you need to diagnose
convergence and stop the MCMC yourself.

If you know how many iterations of MCMC you want, then this
option allows stopping the MCMC after <number> iterations.

To avoid forgotten jobs consuming infinite CPU resources
on a shared computing cluster, MCMC will stop after 200,000
iterations if the maximum number of iterations is not specified.

Examples:

  # Stop after 4000 iterations
  bali-phy dna.fasta -i 4000

  # Don't stop after 200000 iterations:
  bali-phy dna.fasta --iter=100000000000
