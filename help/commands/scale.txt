The --scale command:

-R      [partitions:]prior                  Prior on the Scale.
--scale [partitions:]prior

The branch lengths on the shared tree are multiple by a
partition-specific scale factor to yield the branch lengths for
each partition. Estimating this scale factor allows
estimating the evolutionary rate for the partition.

If no partitions are specified, then every partition gets a
separate scale.
  --scale=~Gamma[0.5,2]

If the scale is not specified, or if no prior is specified,
then the default prior "~Gamma[0.5,2]" for the scale factor is used.

If multiple partitions are specified in the same --scale command,
then they share not just the same distribution on the scale, but
also the same scale.  Thus,
   --scale=2,3:
indicates that partitions 2 and 3 share the same scale, which has
the default scale prior.

If the scale is specified as a constant, such as "--scale=1",
then the scale will not be estimated.

The --scale command can be given multiple times, but the same
partition cannot be referenced twice.

Examples:
   -R ~Gamma[0.5,2]
   --scale=2,3:
   --scale=~Gamma[0.5,2]
   --scale=1
