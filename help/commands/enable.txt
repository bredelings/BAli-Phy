# The `--enable` command:

--enable <moves>                            Enable MCMC moves.

Enable some MCMC moves, provided as a comma-separated list.

A hierarchy of MCMC moves, along with whether they are enabled
or disabled, is displayed in the file `C1.out`. 
These moves can be enabled or disable by name or attribute.

MCMC moves have attributes that be used to enable them:

 * topology:         changes the topology
 * lengths:          changes the branch lengths
 * alignment:        changes the alignment

However, enabling moves by attribute is probably a bad idea.

# Examples:

   # Enable a disabled MCMC move
   bali-phy dna.fasta --enable=sample\_tri\_branch

# See also:

   disable
