# The `--package-path` command:

-P             <paths>                      Directories to search.
--package-path <paths>

BAli-Phy looks in a list of directories to find loadable objects,
haskell modules, model descriptions, and help files.

The default list includes the following (in order) if they exist,

   $HOME/.local/share/bali-phy/packages/
   <exe>/../lib/bali-phy/

where `$HOME` is the user's home directory, and  `<exe>` is the directory
containing the `bali-phy` executable:

You can supply additional directories to search by supply a colon-
separated list of directories.  They are searched, in order, before
the default list.

Non-existant directories are pruned from the package-path. The
package-path will be displayed if `--verbose` is given.

For a given package directory `<dir>`, bali-phy looks in:

   <dir>            - for loadable objects                 (*.DLL, *.so)
   <dir>/modules    - for haskell modules                  (*.hs)
   <dir>/functions  - for models, functions, distributions (.json)
   <dir>/help       - for help files                       (*.txt)

# Examples:

   bali-phy -P ~/Devel/bali-phy/master/:~/my-packages/ dna.fasta --test -V
