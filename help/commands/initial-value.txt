The --initial-value command:

--initial-value <parameter>=<value>         Initialize parameter value.

This command should usually not be used, and only works in
certain cases. If you want to set a parameter to a constant, you
can specify it as part of the model.  For example,
   bali-phy dna.fasta -I RS07[logLambda=-4]
will set logLambda to a constant.  This approach always works,
but will not estimate logLambda since the value is fixed at -4.0.

In contrast, setting the initial value allows estimation of the
parameter and uses the value as a starting point:
   bali-phy dna.fasta -I RS07 --initial-value RS07:logLambda=-4.0
When setting the initial value it is necessary to specify the
decimal point for floating point values.

However, setting initial values only works when the parameter is
directly modifiable.  For example, for 
   RS07[meanIndelLength=Add[1,~Exponential[10]]]
the parameter RS07:meanIndelLength isn't modifiable.  Instead
it is a function of an unnamed modifiable variable created by
~Exponential[10].

Usually a value directly sampled from a distribution is modifiable,
but there are exceptions.  For example, sampling from the
logNormal distributions results in exp[~Normal[lmean,lsigma]],
which is not modifiable.

Likewise, components of Dirichlet distributions are not
modifiable, so it is not possible to set the initial values of
nucleotide frequencies constructed from Dirichlet priors.

Examples:

  # This works.
  bali-phy dna.fasta --initial-value RS07:logLambda=-4.0

  # This does not work.
  bali-phy dna.fasta --initial-value RS07:logLambda=-4

  # This does not work.
  bali-phy dna.fasta --initial-value TN:kappaPur=4.0
