# The `--model` and `--Model` commands:

-m      <file>.hs                           Load model from <file>
--model <file>.hs

-M      <module>                            Load model from <module>
--Model <module>

Load a hierarchical model written in Haskell and perform MCMC. The
`main` function in the module creates the model. If this option is
given, the standard phylogeny and alignment estimation is not
performed.

If using the --model variant of the command, the module is loaded
from the haskell file `<file>.hs`.

If using the --Model variant of the command, the module is expected
to be an installed module.  BAli-Phy searches for installed modules
in the package path (See help on 'package-path'), which includes
`~/.local/share/bali-phy/packages` by default.

You can use the `bali-phy-pkg` command to install packages.
