# The `--seed` command:

-s     <number>                             Specify a random seed.
--seed <number>

Use <number> as a random seed.  BAli-phy uses this random seed
to initialize the pseudo-random number generator.

If a seed is not provided, bali-phy will randomly generate a
different seed each run.  This seed will be recorded in `C1.out`.

Specfying the random seed is usually used to reproduce a given
MCMC run over again.  This can be useful when trying to track
down a bug that occured during a specific run.

# Examples:

   bali-phy dna.fasta --seed=0
  
   bali-phy dna.fasta --seed=29606871437703881
