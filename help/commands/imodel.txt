# The `--imodel` command:

-I       [partitions:]<model>               Insertion-deletion model.
--imodel [partitions:]<model>

The insertion deletion model can be `rs07`, `rs05`, or `none`.  The
default is `rs07`.  A value of `none` means that the alignment is
fixed.

rs07 and rs05 have optional parameters.  These parameters have 
default priors that come into play if the parameters are not
specified.  For example, rs07 defaults to:

   rs07[log_lambda~laplace[-4,0.707],mean_length=~exponential[10,1]]

See help on "parameters" for information on specifying priors or
values.

If no partitions are specified, then every partition gets a separate
unlinked) copy of the model.

If multiple partitions are specified, then the partitions are linked.
That is, they share the same parameter values for the model.

The --imodel command can be given multiple times, but the same
partition cannot be referenced twice.

# Examples:

   -I rs07

   --imodel=rs07

   -I none

   --imodel=none

   -I 1,3:rs07 -I 2:none

In the last example, the indel models of partitions 1 and 3 are linked.
