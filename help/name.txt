The --name command:

-n     <name>                               Name for output directory.
--name <name>

BAli-Phy avoids over-writing output from previous runs by
creating a new directory for each run to contain output files.

If the run is named <name>, BAli-Phy attempts to create <name>-1,
<name>-2, etc. until it finds one that does not already exist.

If the <name> is not given, the input-file names are concatenated
to construct a name.

The <name> is allowed to contain directory separators '/'. Thus
"--name=hi/there" is create the directory "hi/there-1".  If will
first create the directory "hi/" if it does not exist.

Examples:
  bali-phy dna.fasta aa.fasta --name combined
  bali-phy dna.fasta aa.fasta --name subdir/combined
