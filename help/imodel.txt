-I       [partitions:]model                 Insertion-deletion model.
--imodel [partitions:]model

The insertion deletion model can be "RS07", "RS05", or "none".
The default is "RS07".  A value of "none" means that the alignment is fixed.

If no partitions are specified, then every partition gets a separate
(unlinked) copy of the model.

If partitions are specified, then the partitions have linked indel models.
That is, they share the same parameter values for the model.

Examples:
    "--imodel=RS07"    or    "-I RS07"
    "--imodel=none"    or    "-I none"
    "-I 1,3:RS07 -I 2:none"
In the last example, the indel models of partitions 1 and 3 are linked.
