# The `Codons` alphabet:

Codons[nucleotides,genetic-code]

The `Codons` alphabet is used for triplets of DNA or RNA data
where each triplet is mapped to an amino acid.  Stop codons are
removed from the alphabet.

The nucleotides argument can be `DNA`, `RNA`, or missing.  If it
is missing, DNA or RNA is guessed based on frequency of
A,T,G,U, and C in the file.

The genetic code defaults to `standard` if not specified.  See
help on "genetic-code" for a list of supported genetic codes.

# Examples:
