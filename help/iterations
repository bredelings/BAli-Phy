The --iterations command:

-i           <number>                       Number of MCMC iterations.
--iterations <number>

BAli-phy doesn't use a stopping rule, so you need to diagnose
convergence and stop bali-phy yourself.

If you know how many iterations of MCMC you want, then this
option allows stopping the MCMC after <number> iterations.

To avoid using forgotten jobs consuming infinite CPU resources
on a shared computing cluster, MCMC will stop after 200,000
iterations if the maximum number of iterations is not specified.

Examples:

  # Stop after 4000 iterations
  bali-phy dna.fasta -i 4000

  # Don't stop after 200000 iterations:
  bali-phy dna.fasta --iter=100000000000
