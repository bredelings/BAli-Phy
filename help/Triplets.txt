The Triplets alphabet:

Triplets[nucleotides]

The Triplets alphabet is used for triplets of DNA or RNA data.
It is like the Codons alphabet, with the different that:
 * stop codons not excluded from a Triplets alphabet.
 * the genetic code is not known by a Triplets alphabet.
Therefore, the Triplets alphabet cannot be used in models that
estimate dN/dS.

The nucleotides argument can be "DNA", "RNA", or missing.  If it
is missing, DNA or RNA is guessed based on frequency of
A,T,G,U, and C in the file.

Examples:
   Triplets
   Triplets[RNA]
   Triplets[DNA]
