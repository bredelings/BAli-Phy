The Triplets alphabet:

Triplets[nucleotides]

The Triplets alphabet is used for triplets of DNA or RNA data.

The nucleotides argument can be "DNA", "RNA", or missing.  If it
is missing, DNA or RNA is guessed based on frequency of
A,T,G,U, and C in the file.

Examples:
   Triplets
   Triplets[RNA]
   Triplets[DNA]
