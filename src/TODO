Resampling DP::f[] shouldn't require peeling along the tree.
 * The same is true with the gamma width parameter and the fraction of invariant sites.
 * Only changing the rates in each category should require re-peeling.

How to handle resampling of DP::rate* parameters, since they are SORTED?

Make trees-consensus write out a list of partitions directly, so we dont' need 'sed'.

Implement --output=svg,pdf in draw-tree.

Documentation
 - Make programs more self-documenting.
 - Make a 'front matter' page for Doxygen...?
 - Allow `bali-phy --help=topic'
 - Make an --help=advanced to put the advanced usage options in?
 - Remove default from --data-dir
 - Remove --letters=full_tree option.
 - Remove default option from --iterations?

Report a 95% confidence interval of splits
 - scale by # of internal branches in tree... then should be < than # of iterations, just like #topologies.

Alignment-indices: intelligently find the previous/next column.
 - Command line: constrain columns... use range parsing code from alignment-cat
 - Actually, do something more intelligent based on pairwise things, like FSA does...
   + But then how would you take advantage of local conservation... "ALL sequences have a G"

Make moves report meaningful names for their various statistics.
 - Make the MCMC::stats( ) object into a map<string,pair<int,double> > or something.
 - Make NNI report how many branches peeled on average,
 - Make SPR report how many branches peeled on average divided T.n_branches()

Handle two-directory case better: make outfile be a list.
 * Alignment-max and alignment-consensus should also take multiple input files.

Report
 - I can generate a mixing graph by comparing column probabilities for different alignments...
 - I can also generate ESS values per column.
 - This is only going to be meaningful when the column support is not too small or too large.
 - I can generate more plots, if R is installed.
   * Generate the mixing diagnostics chart.  If one chain only, take 2,3,4 quarters.

Have I fixed the debug trap?

Timers:
 - Why is SPR_and_A_all taking essentially the same amount of CPU time as each of SPR_and_A_flat,
     despite being (I think) called more?
 - Are SPR_and_A_flat( ) and SPR_and_A_path( ) really taking twice as much CPU time as SPR_and_A_all( )?
   + Might this relate to SPR_and_A_all( ) ignoring cherries?
 - Run nodes_master more often.... for long sequences?  When substitution is slow?
 - Why am I getting +-1.0e-15 errors in some times?
 - Why does SPR_and_A_nodes sometimes register 0 CPU time despite having 100 calls?
 - Just doing a simple NNI is actually a lot faster than doing walk_tree_sample_branch_lengths( )
   + How does this depend on whether there is an alignment present?
   + Should I do more NNIs?

Is the beginning EXTRA slow because the size of the likelihood cache is changed a lot???
 - each resize has a cost that is probably about that of 2 MH updates on mu1.
 - if this was does for each branch alignment, that that would be O(B^2)
 - (check with --verbose)

Automatically adjusting step widths:
 * I need an over-arching controller or structure?
 * How do I expose a 'control' interface for MH moves?
   - I need to expose a control knob on the proposal?
 * How do I adjust (and do I need to) step widths for branch lengths?

Lazily recalculate branch transition matrices.

Can I fix PSRF-80% by finding the SMALLEST 80%-wide interval?
 * well, no, because a much larger 80.001% would still cause a problem.

Speed up mctree-mean-lengths.

Branch priors - make into a sub-model, allow a mixture-of-two-{Exponential, Gamma}.

Build constraints the same way FSA does.

Replace T.branch(  ) with T.undirected_branch( ) or T.branch( ).undirected(). [step 1]
Replace T.directed_branch( ) with T.branch( ). [step 2]

Branch lengths for mc-trees
- Can I get branch lengths for the mctree... but without node sizes?
- For each branch, mask out taxa that wander over 
  * edges directly connected (mask of A, A<<B, A does not directly wander)
  * edges that wander over the same region as we do (~A.group1, A<<B, A directly wanders) 
  Node masks simply mask out all taxa that wander over connected edges.

  Then, if a branch implies a partition with its new, increased, mask, then contribute to that partition.

  What are the resulting corner cases?
   - the same branch can imply two parallel edges.
   - if X and Y wander over 12|34, then what if the sample tree has XY|1234 ?
     + X and Y have the reduced splits X|1234 and Y|1234, so XY|1234 implies both.
     + we therefore give half the length to each one.
   - when does each branch in a compatible tree imply just one reduced split?

 * How do they record/store their bandwidths?

P28. Make alignment-indices handle the one-sequence-is-entirely-gaps case.
 * Count conservation w/o looking at gaps.
 * Even in a conserved column, a non-gap character is unsafe if there is a gap IN THAT SEQUENCE w/in three columns.
  - Of course... COLUMNS isn't quite the issue... We'd need at tree etc...
 * (How to derived such constraints from MCMC alignment output?)
 * Idea: randomly propose alignment constraints based on past samples?
 * But, still getting THOSE samples can benefit from a priori constraints.
P5. Speed up post-processing.

P23. What should the ideal mixing rate be for topologies? (accept based on MCMC fractions)
P20. Adaptive bandwith computation
- Consider a move with a bandwidth around the current path
- Consider specifying an input alignment around which to calculate bandwidths.
  + (?) Use the input alignment in the prior?
P24. Improve speed of dynamic programming
- sort states to group those with the same prev state (i.e. same di and dj)
P2. Determine how much tree sampling could be improved by proposing with the right branch lengths.
 - Implement a kind of SPR_all move, but based on the number of topology samples, only.
 - Output is posterior probability of topology.
 - Is the probably of the data given a topology just the average of the likelihoods given the topology?

P25. Fix Slice NNI, and determine why 3-way NNI isn't better than 2-way NNI.
 * Slice NNI changes w/ max probability 50% in 2-way case, 66% in 3-way case.
   - Can we improve this, somehow?  Ask Paul Lewis?  Explain NNI-slice moves?
 * Why is the 3-way NNI (choose_MH) only accepting slightly more often than the 2-way NNI?

P26. Improve drawing of multiconnected trees by using equal-daylight.

 - implement back-off - that is, allow thinning out of 
P35. [Cleanup] Move MC_tree_with_lengths to mctree.H, and make an operator<<( ) for it.

P1. Implement the multi-branch SPR search
 * Choose subtree to prune based on the effective-branch length?
 * Improve accuracy, simplicity of "effective-branch" length?
   - Check if the length of neighboring branches has an effect...
 * Finish testing.
   - Check profiler results.
   - Compare Lutzoni-Fungi results with old version. (seems good, so far).

P17. Improve alphabet handling for speed, flexibility, and features.
     - [!]Speed up mapping of letters to integers.

     - (?) Handle lower-case nucleotides by allowing synonyms for letters.
     - (?) Make upper-case letters synonyms?
     - Individually add letters: add_letter("a","Adenosine","A")
     - Single-letter alphabets just use an array to map letters to integers.
     - Generic word alphabets use a map<string,int>.

P16. Generate better mixing diagnostics
     - RNe1 and RCI1 aren't really working, though MSDSF is OK.
     - Report SDSF for each split.
     - Report what lartillot is reporting, also.

P3. [Speed up burn-in]
 * Include a minimum-distance-based proposal?  How?
   - This would only help if the current state was REALLY bad, but that could actually happen during burnin.
   - This is a data-driven proposal... which can be good.

 * Do, in order:
Step 1
 * scale parameters
 * branch lengths
 * substitution model parameters
 * indel model parameters (?)

Step 2
 * search the topology as well using only the likelihood

Step 3
 * search the topology using minimal interpolated internal node states.

Step 4
 * internal node states (two_way)

Step 5 
 * alignment

Do we want to freeze the tree while we do our initial alignment updates?

Goals:
 - Allow quick estimation
 - Remove the initial constraint on indel parameters changing...
   ... Yet still avoid temporary unalignment.
 - If the right alignment is provide, then never get worse.
 - Improve burnin on Roshan's many-taxon test case.

Ideas:
- Do an initial MCMC with alternative parameters
  + Where do we send output for this MCMC?
- Do an initial tree search.  Does this decrease temporary unalignment?
  + Branch lengths?
  + Topology?
- Do an initial POY-style optimization.  How much faster can this be?
- Issue: we can just try to estimate alignments, BUT
  + How do we score gap penalties?
  + There is A/T interaction.

P10. Make CAT models faster.
 - Can this be virtualized?  How much speed do we lose by computing exp(Qt)*v using a virtual call?
 - Can I avoid recalculating exp_a_t so often?

P5. [Post-processing:]
  + We actually spend a lot of time DRAWING the mc trees.
  + What is a fast way to estimate node lengths?

  + When printing SRQ plots, indicate the LOD range (or its abs?).
  + Make trees-bootstrap less RAM-intensive: don't cache so many things.
  + We actually need to compute:
    * Bootstrap sample of LOD
    * Bootstrap sample of PP

P11. [Summarize multiple chains]
  + Modify statreport to take multiple (identical) files for estimation of
    means, ACT, etc.
  + Make bp-analyze handle multiple INPUT directories!

P17. [Speed up trees-distances]
 + We should be able to ignore splits for leaf branches.
 + Does "topology-record" succeed in ignoring these splits?  Can we try that?
 + What if we wanted topology_record to record average branch lengths?  Can we do that?
 + We could sort the branches of the tree by bit-order, to make it easy to find which ones match.
   - This should substantially reduce the N^2 cost.

P6. What different tasks do I want?  How can I make a generic tree processor?
 + Find the PP>X consensus tree
 + Find the PP>X splits
 + Find the PP>X partial splits
 + Annotate branches of a Query tree with their lengths from a tree sample
 + Annotate branches of a Query tree with their PP/BF   from a tree sample

Defaults:If no ">X" part, then >-
        :If no "[i]" part, then "[0]"

Idea: level[i]>file@format

Questions: Do I have to re-analyze the combined file?
           Can I share memory && information between different 

Can I get away w/o manually scripting intermediate variables?
That is, if I do --consensus-tree=0.5>a --consensus-topology=0.5>b, can I re-use
  the information about topology?

 --msdsf=file@report
 * write out the RANGE of support for each partition, sorted by the average support.

-? I need a "verbose" mode that gives feedback for progress.
-? How do I handle dependencies?

Also, the easiest time to calculate branch lengths would be when we
are looking up the branches in the first place. Do we really want to
have a "calculate branch lengths" and a "don't calculate branch
lengths" option on estimating partition support? 


Why does INV+Modulated+gamma[4]+INV crash?
    - Because you can't add models with different alphabet sizes ATM.

 (d) 'Var' analysis? -- Compare within / between variance for multiple chains.

5. Diagnostics
 (a) For discrete ranges: average fraction of total confidence interval in individual 80% ranges/0.8
     * This should not allow large changes in the statistic for infinitessimal changes in the distribution.
 (b) 

P26. Improve draw-tree
 1. Make draw-tree use device coordinates
   + But make this a separate, final, step?
 2. Put label lengths into leaf branch lengths.
 3. Fix equal-daylight to handle the case when there is no daylight available.
   + If there is no daylight, then make all angles go a /= 2
   + (?) Recalculate daylight under the condition that distance branches are ignored?
   * Also: do Dave's monkey-puzzle technique.
 4. Represent multiconnected tree as a regular tree, and use equal-daylight to place nodes,
    although they will have clouds
   + At first, assume that wandering branches attach at existing nodes, instead of in the middle of branches.
 5. Do not draw the line UNDER the cloud.... instead draw the line and cut it off at the cloud boundary. 
   + This requires some kind of path API.

 B. How to handle rooted trees?
    B1. Where is reversibility assumed?

-1. M7 should take a complete model, not just an exchange model!

0. The trees-consensus "--ignore taxon1,taxon2,.." functionality doesn't actually work?

1. Fix the Uniform distribution to have a sigma/mu parameter.

2. Branch length proposals
   (a) Can we SPEED UP the procedure to fit/estimate the posterior to a gamma?
       i. Guess the starting distance and variance from the conditional probabilities on
          both sides of the branch...
      ii. But what if there are multiple rates or frequencies?
   (b) Single branch: can we accept more NNI/SPR if we sample the branch length?
   (c) Can we sample from a MULTIPLE branch distribution?
   (d) Can we ignore the indel effects on branch lengths when we do?
   (e) How does the acceptance rate for fit_gamma depend on n_retries?

3. Multiple branch-length proposals
   (a) When considering multiple branch lengths, the information CAN be about the
       specific branches T[i] instead of the distances D[i][j] if we can infer WHICH
       branch the mutations happened on.

4. Topology proposals which alter multiple branches:
   (1) SPR connecting branch
   (2) SPR branch + merged branch
   (3) SPR branch + split branch (2)
   (4) SPR branch + split branch (2) + merged branch (1)
   (5) SPR branch + split branch (2) + adjacent in pruned tree (2)
   (6) SPR branch + split branch (2) + merged branch (1) + adjacent in pruned tree (2)

   (6?) SPR branch + merged branch (1) + neighbors (4)
   (7?) SPR branch + split branch (2) + neighbors (4)
   (12?) SPR branch + merged branch (1) + neighbors (4) + split branch (2) + neighbors (4)

5. How much of the sequence is in each %-identity fraction?
  a) How much information is in each fraction?
  b) How do we make sure that mismatched residues in the 90% identity fraction 
      don't end up in the 0% identity fraction?
  c) Do gaps count as "mismatches"? 
     Which leads to...
  d) Can we combine measures of gappiness and %-identity to yield a
     measure of ambiguity? 

6. GTR: When setting parameters, set all relevant parameters at once?

7. Write a program to try to combine trees (sub-branches?)

  c) difference from consensus = 1 (no shared differences)
  d) 
  e) percentage of sites w/ an indel
  f) print the column number in the comments of each row

10. Use a RJMCMC on a fixed alignment to model locate changes in 'mu'
   +  or use a change-point model?
   +  or use a *nested* Change Point Model?
   + we need some way to find out if the gamma model "fits" well! (how
much of the variation is spatial?)

11. Find a way to display differences between alignments (alignment distributions?)
   + show how alignments vary
   + find parts of alignments which COVARY with the tree
     - does the tree cause the alignment to vary, or vice versa?

2. Put "epsilon" on the "mean_indel_length" scale.
5. Proposals and Priors
  a. use a parameter_names_ vector.
6. Output move stats in tracer-readable format. (or, at least, allow burn-in?)

7. How about having an alphabet option "AAA -" to indicate that this item is missing?

--------------------------------------------------------

-48. Indel model where we sum over all root locations: doesn't work for SPR?
  a. A mixture of P(A|root) doesn't factor into P(A[1]) * P(A[2]) * ... * P(A[B])
  b. We would have to augment the data with a root.
  [NOTE] But can we resample an alignment under a *mixture* of distributions.

-46. Code an initial test for the same-frequencies assumption?
	- likelihood ratio test: sequences S have frequencies p
                                 sequence S[i] has frequencies q 
	- can we reject p=q?  How much is the actual difference?
        - or, find groups using neighbor-joining? 
          + (twice as many branches..)
	  + N^2 cost of computing the pairwise distances...
            - how to make semi-additive distances?

-45. Speed up likelihood calculations where there are lots of gaps??
  + If there is only one character then (at least for equilibrium processes)
    the cost should be constant.
  + If there is more than one character, then the  cost should be proportional to
    the number of branches that connect the non-gap characters.

-------------------------------------------------------
 o Parsimony Model -> constant branch lengths
   - only change SPR, disable branch-length moves
     * this is if we do it at the tree-level
     * this SHOULD handle the multiple-rates case... or does it?
   - or, do it at the level of the substitution model
     * how do we set the length to "mu", or how do we handle P.branch_mean() in this case?
     * this SHOULD handle the multiple-rates case... or does it?
 o Gamma branch length model
 o compare posteriors for Full model, Parsimony model, and in-between model
   where T[i] = mu^a * b[i]^(1-a)
 o Use the parsimony posterior to propose or select far-away trees
   - (but is this any better than simply bootstrapping the posterior sample?)
   - MCMCMC approach with no (with parsimony) branch lengths.

 o Separating NNI & SPR into their own files
 o Add ECR 
   - re-sampling internal node states on more than 2 branches
 o Writing a function to approximate the branch-length distribution
   for a large number of adjacent branches
 o a better form for the joint branch density than a normal.

-------------------------------------------------------

-41. Improve proposals: 
  + Specify the NUMBER of times we do each increment per iteration.
  + How can we reference other parameters of the model? (e.g. "mu")
  + How do we pass back information about move success from each move?
  + Can we have the move parameters converge to something?
    - Should this be in the PROPOSAL, or something governing the proposal?

-------------------------------------------------------
Paper:
 * how to tell if a tree distribution is following a guide tree?
   Average # of shared branches?  How else to measure bias resulting
   from a fixed alignment?

TODO:
 * Write a tool to take a list of files, find common columns, and
    write out differently names files: 1.p, 2.p, ...
   - warn about over-writing files.

 * tree-mean-lengths: compute the length of each branch or node, conditioned on the
   existance of said branch or node.
   - if a branch doesn't exist - give it length 0.
   - if a node doesn't exist... also give it length 0?
 * fix alignment-find when last alignment is chopped.
 * alignment-info
   + use a neighbor-joining tree if no tree is supplied?
   + report # of indels (but internal sequences are missing!)

-------------------------------------------------------
Questions:

 Q: How can the distribution of INV::p be so exponential? (AATS)
 A1: Strong incorrect prior, not enought data!
 A2: Probably this happens more with gamma[] than log-normal[], since the gamma
     allows very low rate classes.  Does it happen with DP[5]?

-------------------------------------------------------

-37. Improve trees-consensus
  + Compute the entire set of branches / counts for full partitions.
  + Compute the greedy tree using these counts.
  + Report the first 4(N-3) internal branches.
    - Also report the  branches in the greedy tree?
  + [FIX] Currently the number of sub-branches is capped at |c50|
  + [FIX] 'ratio' for sub-partitions when parent partitions are below the min.
  + store topology as list of locations in partition list?
   a) Would this save memory?
      Some, if some of full partitions have a high frequency.
   b) Would this save CPU time?  Examine each partition once instead of n times.
      [But this wouldn't help for sub-partitions, would it?]
   c) We could report the number of full partitions that we observe.

-34. Can we put a Gamma prior on branch length? (Conjugate?)

  d) handle alignment predicates in the SRQ plot.
     can we output residues which are mixing badly?

-22. FastLSA with Constraints:
  + We have a series of tiles that are linked at their corners.
    - In each tile, we go forward given the (0,0) corner
    - We sample backwards given the (last) state at the (I,J) corner.

-3. Think more carefully about using walk_tree_path
     + when changing the topology...  does this have to be reversible?

5. Allow branch length mixtures?

6. Improve mixing for multi_freq model by sampling between columns.
    a) well, firstly, why does convergence take SOO long?
    b) if we could easily just change bin probabilities, then that would
       make it easier to attack this problem by increasing the number
       of MH steps we do.

7. Make a hash function for sub-partitions that is 
     (hash(left mask) * hash(right mask)), where the hash() function

       * initialize boundaries in forward_square, with special case for (1,1)=S(0,0)

        b) trees-bootstrap bootstraps support for partitions, possibly
           from multiple tree samples.
          i) speed up the trees-bootstrap by using the same samples
             for each predicate, so that we need only generate the
             random numbers once.

*IDEAS*

 - We need better ways to compute compute marginal likelihoods.

 - for HIV data, we want samples from DIFFERENT PATIENTS, not
   from the same patient, because recombination is limitted to
   within-patient samples.

   if we can avoid co-infection, then we are good!

   (a) check Shankarrapa samples from the HIV database...
   (b) ? ask Marc about asking people if we can use their data
       or asking questions about their data.

 - find some papers for the journal club?

 - introduce alphabet models - such as codon model frequencies depending
   on [A],[T],[G],and [C].  We allow them to deviate, but put evidence on
   them NOT deviating.

 - consider modelling functional divergence - Karin's branch problem?

 - for alignment - how do we balance "extra high rate of change on this branch"
   (e.g. different aa on each side ) with "unalign the two sides of this
   branch"?

 - if we can take a <X>% confidence region in tree space, then any strict
   consensus measure of that region would be an level-<X> consensus tree.

 - we could search for the <X>% of the samples that would give the most
   resolved tree.

 - consider a version of pair-HMM with 2x as many states: we would have a 
   "slow" and "fast" version of M,G1,G2 in which indels have different
   rates.

 -  more complex model: have 'slow' and 'fast' be properties of the
   individual letters in the state.  (gamma-distributed indel rates.)
   + this makes a "spatial" model, if it is done right.

 -  Homoplasy and variation in column frequencies.  
   a) have a 'two-letter' model for HIV sequence DNA.

 - "Autocorrelation" as a function of distance

   o graph distances as a function of the posterior LOD score of the events.

   o graph probability of the transition from 1->0 (or 1->0->1) vs time AND PP.

 - use proxy for Likelihood to propose new states.
   o look at the number of SPR changes required to reach "nearby" trees,
     and to move between "islands".=======
 -  graph distances as a function of the posterior LOD score of the events.

 -  IDEA #1: simulate P(Y|T,tau) as \prod P(Y[i][j]|T,tau)^n[i][j]
            where n[i][j] = 1/2**(D(i,j)-1) 
            wjere D(i,j) is the number of edges between nodes i and j.

 -  IDEA #2: Determine points C[i] as centers for n bins of a distribution.
            + bin boundaries will be at sqrt(C[i]*C{i+1]).
            + define f(x) = C[i] if x is in the i-th bin.
            + then we 
              - constrain E X = 1 under f(x).
              - minimize E |log(X) - log(f(X))|

	    + this will give us bins optimally spaced on the log scale.

    (Note: If the transform function is the quantile function, instead of the
     log function, then we regain the current standard behavior! :)

 - If we look at posterior rate distributions, then we will want to know
   how the rates are distributed spatially.  (This might explain why the
   shape of the rate distribution varies between proteins.)

   How much of the rate distribution can be explained by e.g. exposure
   to solvent?

   If we add alpha/beta/loop notation to each of the internal node residues,
   then this might help us get more realistic rates, as well as indel
   hot and cold spots.

 - How do indel hot and cold spots map to interior/exterior of 3D structure?

 - Can we label each residue with the probability that it will accept deletion?
   Can we label proposed indels with a relative probability of occurrence?
   (Invariant residues/blocks are easier, because they are never inserted.)
   Can we handle a model with both unequal proposals and acceptance rates?

 - If the invariant sites vary over time, we might achieve some fairly interesting
   decoupling of change from linear time.  If sites become invariant during some
   period of time, then they might change fairly little over a rather long time.
   If some sites become variable, then they might change a lot over a fairly short
   time.  If sites change their invariancy in blocks... then we could have an 
   interesting interaction of changes in selection and fitness effects over the
   tree.

 - Can we estimate selection pressure over the tree?  
   We could integrate out the parts we don't know.

 - Can we separate the alphabet/frequency model from the exchangeability
   model for substitution models?

   * This way, YangM0 doesn't have an HKY::f parameter.
   * This way, the *::f parameter is handled much more naturally.
   * This way, we can handle frequency parameters as parameters.
   * This way, we don't have a fixed *::f parameter, unless we need it.
   * This way, we can have more interesting codon frequency models.

 - If we have both coding and non-coding DNA from an organism (hopefully
   from a number of genes, and, I suppose, non-coding regions), then we
   could actually fit a model that determined the frequency of codons from
   the competing pressure of nucleotide and amino acide forces.

   Actually, we might need three different components:

   a) nucleotide mutation pressure
   b) nucleotide content selection pressure
   c) amino acid selection pressure

   Might only amino acid content change between genes?  In that case, we might
   be able to estiamte all the factors using only coding regions!

-  Model RNA as a sequence with variable equilibrium distributions...
   There are only 2^4 = 16 rate classes if everything is 0/1.
   Entropy???     

-  Site-dependent equilibrium frequencies:
  + Question: does entropy of frequencies affect branch lengths?
  + Combine saturation with (site-dependent) rate-change across the tree ?
  + Check effect of non-equivalent equilbrium frequencies.

- Quick ways to score gaps: tell Jeff.
   + Push gaps as high as possible in each column.
   + No nested gaps
   + Linear gaps

- Don't show SRQ or sum plots for partitions w/ less than <N=10> regenerations,
     a) But, perhaps the real issue is generating a confidence band for SRQ plots
     b) Develop an idea of how to do a statistical test based on SRQ plots...
        [ Find the worst sub-section - the flattest line that is longest ]
        [ This will give us the worst mixing rate that we can reject ]
