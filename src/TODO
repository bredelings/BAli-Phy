    (b) load smodels similarly
    (c) load imodels similarly
 B. don't crash on alignments of 1 sequence...
 C. Store smodels above the partition level, with a mapping to partiitons
	E3b. What logic here is re-usable?
 D. Currently we are altering the smodel inside the partitions.
    This requires copying it...
    (a) how expensive is this?
    (b) how easy to change?

 B. Non-DPP prior on number of columns in each category.
 C. DPP when number of columns is changing?
 D. 150 pi * 4 rates = 600 bins = impossible?

Improved Codon models/notation?
 A. F1x4 / F3x4 / F61
 B. We should be able to do some Marginal Likelihood tests on these.

1. Fix the Uniform distribution to have a sigma/mu parameter.

2. Branch length proposals
   (a) Can we SPEED UP the procedure to fit/estimate the posterior to a gamma?
       i. Guess the starting distance and variance from the conditional probabilities on
          both sides of the branch...
      ii. But what if there are multiple rates or frequencies?
   (b) Single branch: can we accept more NNI/SPR if we sample the branch length?
   (c) Can we sample from a MULTIPLE branch distribution?
   (d) Can we ignore the indel effects on branch lengths when we do?
   (e) How does the acceptance rate for fit_gamma depend on n_retries?

3. Multiple branch-length proposals
   (a) When considering multiple branch lengths, the information CAN be about the
       specific branches T[i] instead of the distances D[i][j] if we can infer WHICH
       branch the mutations happened on.

4. Topology proposals which alter multiple branches:
   (1) SPR connecting branch
   (2) SPR branch + merged branch
   (3) SPR branch + split branch (2)
   (4) SPR branch + split branch (2) + merged branch (1)
   (5) SPR branch + split branch (2) + adjacent in pruned tree (2)
   (6) SPR branch + split branch (2) + merged branch (1) + adjacent in pruned tree (2)

   (6?) SPR branch + merged branch (1) + neighbors (4)
   (7?) SPR branch + split branch (2) + neighbors (4)
   (12?) SPR branch + merged branch (1) + neighbors (4) + split branch (2) + neighbors (4)

5. How much of the sequence is in each %-identity fraction?
  a) How much information is in each fraction?
  b) How do we make sure that mismatched residues in the 90% identity fraction 
      don't end up in the 0% identity fraction?
  c) Do gaps count as "mismatches"? 
     Which leads to...
  d) Can we combine measures of gappiness and %-identity to yield a
     measure of ambiguity? 

6. GTR: When setting parameters, set all relevant parameters at once?

6. Write a program to try to combine trees (sub-branches?)
   (a) Print out the tree of no-conflict branches
   (b) Show conflicting pairs of branches from each file.
   (c) Start with trees - no branches in the same file can conflict.

7. Implement multiple data partitions...  (on a branch)
  (a) More than one alignment + scaling between the trees
  (b) More than one substitution model?

8. Implement Correlated Site Classes.
  (a) Do the math.
    (i) When caching HMM state values, we must ALSO cache rates!
  (b) Do the coding?

9. Estimate constraints using alignment-indices
  a) specify number of constraints
  b) no gaps nearby (distance W+G) from constraint
  c) difference from consensus = 1 (no shared differences)
  d) 
  e) percentage of sites w/ an indel
  f) print the column number in the comments of each row

10. Use a RJMCMC on a fixed alignment to model locate changes in 'mu'
   +  or use a change-point model?
   +  or use a *nested* Change Point Model?
   + we need some way to find out if the gamma model "fits" well! (how
much of the variation is spatial?)

11. Find a way to display differences between alignments (alignment distributions?)
   + show how alignments vary
   + find parts of alignments which COVARY with the tree
     - does the tree cause the alignment to vary, or vice versa?

1. Test sampling of epsilon.  (Implement model where lambda & epsilon not coupled?)
  a) e-mail about the method for converting matrices from WAG to codon level.
2. Put "epsilon" on the "mean_indel_length" scale.
5. Proposals and Priors
  a. use a parameter_names_ vector.
6. Output move stats in tracer-readable format. (or, at least, allow burn-in?)

7. How about having an alphabet option "AAA -" to indicate that this item is missing?
8. How about switching from '!' to '*' to indicate stop codons? 
   (And stop using * as a wildcard character? We could use '.' instead, based on regular expressions.
    And in most cases we can use N or X anyway.)

13.  It would be nice to handle revisiting a tree when removing duplicates
     in trees-distances.


FIX:
1. Alignment consensus isn't taking into account conflict of the
partial ordering that is created by the requirement that residues in
each sequence must have a lower column number that later characters in
the same sequence.
  a. For example 1:x ~ 2:y forbids 1:x-1 ~ 2:y+1
  b. In general, 1:x ~ 2:y means that residues in sequence 1 are now
ordered ALSO with respect to residues in sequence 2.
  c. When trying to align 1:x ~ 2:y we find the neighboring residues
in 1:* that are aligned to 2:*. When check that their indices in 2:*
bracket y.  (If we do this for 1:* then we don't have to do it for 2:*).
--------------------------------------------------------

-48. Indel model where we sum over all root locations: doesn't work for SPR?
  a. A mixture of P(A|root) doesn't factor into P(A[1]) * P(A[2]) * ... * P(A[B])
  b. We would have to augment the data with a root.

-46. Code an initial test for the same-frequencies assumption?
	- likelihood ratio test: sequences S have frequencies p
                                 sequence S[i] has frequencies q 
	- can we reject p=q?  How much is the actual difference?
        - or, find groups using neighbor-joining? 
          + (twice as many branches..)
	  + N^2 cost of computing the pairwise distances...
            - how to make semi-additive distances?

-45. Speed up likelihood calculations where there are lots of gaps??
  + If there is only one character then (at least for equilibrium processes)
    the cost should be constant.
  + If there is more than one character, then the  cost should be proportional to
    the number of branches that connect the non-gap characters.

-------------------------------------------------------
 o Parsimony Model -> constant branch lengths
   - only change SPR, disable branch-length moves
     * this is if we do it at the tree-level
     * this SHOULD handle the multiple-rates case... or does it?
   - or, do it at the level of the substitution model
     * how do we set the length to "mu", or how do we handle P.branch_mean() in this case?
     * this SHOULD handle the multiple-rates case... or does it?
 o Gamma branch length model
 o compare posteriors for Full model, Parsimony model, and in-between model
   where T[i] = mu^a * b[i]^(1-a)
 o Use the parsimony posterior to propose or select far-away trees
   - (but is this any better than simply bootstrapping the posterior sample?)
   - MCMCMC approach with no (with parsimony) branch lengths.

 o Separating NNI & SPR into their own files
 o Add ECR 
   - re-sampling internal node states on more than 2 branches
 o Writing a function to approximate the branch-length distribution
   for a large number of adjacent branches
 o a better form for the joint branch density than a normal.

-------------------------------------------------------

-41. Improve proposals: 
  + Specify the NUMBER of times we do each increment per iteration.
  + How can we reference other parameters of the model? (e.g. "mu")
  + How do we pass back information about move success from each move?
  + Can we have the move parameters converge to something?
    - Should this be in the PROPOSAL, or something governing the proposal?

-------------------------------------------------------
Paper:
 * how to tell if a tree distribution is following a guide tree?
   Average # of shared branches?  How else to measure bias resulting
   from a fixed alignment?

WHY...
 * is the fragment model downward-biased for epsilon?
 * 

Before 2.0
 * Eliminate dependency on PERL (genreport)
 * Brief descriptions of some of the tools.
 * (?) Add some more comments to the code.
 * Why do gcc 4.1 and 4.2 give different answers for alignment sampling
   moves???
 * Why aren't any likelihood moves accepted at all for the cad-v2 data set?
 * Implement Branch length prior distributions
 * fix SPR2 to use ACTUAL gamma proposal, not stupid Exponential(mu) proposal.
   (done, but worse acceptance rates?  And, only for --traditional.)


After 1.9.9:
 * Write a tool to take a list of files, find common columns, and
    write out differently names files: 1.p, 2.p, ...
   - warn about over-writing files.
 * Data Partitions
   - look up the lock() complications!
   - 
 * tree-mean-lengths: compute the length of each branch or node, conditioned on the
   existance of said branch or node.
   - if a branch doesn't exist - give it length 0.
   - if a node doesn't exist... also give it length 0?
 * print out several alignments in a way that can be extracted???
 * fix alignment-find when last alignment is chopped.
 * speed up trees-consensus (for large trees)
 * Fix Dirichlet Priors (?)
   - fix prior on frequencies.
   - fix prior on INV2.
   - fix *proposals* for INV2?
 * Profile trees-consensus on 48b.fasta
   - It seems to take measurable time processing EACH level of consensus.
 * alignment-info
   + use a neighbor-joining tree if no tree is supplied?
   + report # of indels (but internal sequences are missing!)

Before 2.0:
 * Do the autoconf magic to compile GSL in-tree?
-------------------------------------------------------
Questions:

-------------------------------------------------------

-40. Remove bitvector functions from tree.H!

        reading alignments.
     b) Speed up time to read alignments.
          
-37. Improve trees-consensus
  + Compute the entire set of branches / counts for full partitions.
  + Compute the greedy tree using these counts.
  + Report the first 4(N-3) internal branches.
    - Also report the  branches in the greedy tree?
  + [FIX] Currently the number of sub-branches is capped at |c50|
  + [FIX] 'ratio' for sub-partitions when parent partitions are below the min.
  + store topology as list of locations in partition list?
   a) Would this save memory?
      Some, if some of full partitions have a high frequency.
   b) Would this save CPU time?  Examine each partition once instead of n times.
      [But this wouldn't help for sub-partitions, would it?]
   c) We could report the number of full partitions that we observe.

-34. Can we put a Gamma prior on branch length? (Conjugate?)

-30. Find out where the system time is coming from...
  + Find out the system time for a test case with DP full-matrix.
  + Where is the system time coming from? (Use oprofile?)

-27. More data sets - more proteins!  
     Read some more tree-of-life papers.
	Which protein was it that supposedly did not saturate?  Can we plot saturation?  
	Can we determine the equilibrium distribution (effective entropy) ... by thinking about T ... ?

-24. Benchmarking of mixing... 
  a) try with alignment fixed
  b) look at log autocorrelation and effective sample sizes for distances
     between 2 nodes + sum all branches + sum all paths
  c) compare mixing with few taxa, many taxa...
  d) handle alignment predicates in the SRQ plot.
     can we output residues which are mixing badly?

-22. FastLSA with Constraints:
  + We have a series of tiles that are linked at their corners.
    - In each tile, we go forward given the (0,0) corner
    - We sample backwards given the (last) state at the (I,J) corner.
    - We need to SHARE the emission probabilities between tiles.

-21. Complain if a tree has two leaves with the same name?
     (We crash on 'standardize' currently.)

     b) Report by marking a consensus alignment with a continuous or thresh-hold color scheme.
     c) How does a distribution of alignment CONSENSII fit into this?
 
-12. Allow alignment-gild to annotate an alignment-consensus

-10. Make trees-bootstrap.C print trees instead of collections of full partitions.

-7. Sanitize use of the MAP tree when the count is 1. Report a median?
     + but the estimated probability of the median could be 0.
     + this matters only when computing branch lengths?

-3. Think more carefully about using walk_tree_path
     + when changing the topology...  does this have to be reversible?

------
1. Plot #topologies in confidence interval (0,p) vs p. (e.g. sort topologies)
    Then plot this versus time...

    Also compare this between runs...

    Figure out burnin for bacteria data sets...

2. Test with STLport, libstdc++ debugging code.

3. Indel model - fix so that prior probabilities exist!
    a) for now, we condition on leaf sequence lengths.

4. Start making some "nice" pictures to put up on the website.
    a) include pictures to give to Dr. Lake's lab.

5. Allow branch length mixtures?

6. Improve mixing for multi_freq model by sampling between columns.
    a) well, firstly, why does convergence take SOO long?
    b) if we could easily just change bin probabilities, then that would
       make it easier to attack this problem by increasing the number
       of MH steps we do.

7. Make a hash function for sub-partitions that is 
     (hash(left mask) * hash(right mask)), where the hash() function
     is a hash function for bitmasks and involves addition, not
     multiplication.

*D. Make alignment-draw be able to output EPS

E. how does P(data|model) depend on number of frequency bins?

II. model: Make INV categories depend on letters, somehow...

III. sample lengths/topologies MORE often when alignment sampling also?

IV. A new ggobi is available!  Try multidimensional scaling...

V. Start proposing INV::p on the log odds scale. It is OK to change
the prior, because we never want to use it  differently.

       * initialize boundaries in forward_square, with special case for (1,1)=S(0,0)

*IDEAS*

 - We need better ways to compute compute marginal likelihoods.

 - for HIV data, we want samples from DIFFERENT PATIENTS, not
   from the same patient, because recombination is limitted to
   within-patient samples.

   if we can avoid co-infection, then we are good!

   (a) check Shankarrapa samples from the HIV database...
   (b) ? ask Marc about asking people if we can use their data
       or asking questions about their data.

 - find some papers for the journal club?

 - introduce alphabet models - such as codon model frequencies depending
   on [A],[T],[G],and [C].  We allow them to deviate, but put evidence on
   them NOT deviating.

 - consider modelling functional divergence - Karin's branch problem?

 - for alignment - how do we balance "extra high rate of change on this branch"
   (e.g. different aa on each side ) with "unalign the two sides of this
   branch"?

 - if we can take a <X>% confidence region in tree space, then any strict
   consensus measure of that region would be an level-<X> consensus tree.

 - we could search for the <X>% of the samples that would give the most
   resolved tree.

 - consider a version of pair-HMM with 2x as many states: we would have a 
   "slow" and "fast" version of M,G1,G2 in which indels have different
   rates.

 -  more complex model: have 'slow' and 'fast' be properties of the
   individual letters in the state.  (gamma-distributed indel rates.)
   + this makes a "spatial" model, if it is done right.

 -  Homoplasy and variation in column frequencies.  
   a) have a 'two-letter' model for HIV sequence DNA.

 - "Autocorrelation" as a function of distance

   o graph distances as a function of the posterior LOD score of the events.

   o graph probability of the transition from 1->0 (or 1->0->1) vs time AND PP.

 - use proxy for Likelihood to propose new states.
   o look at the number of SPR changes required to reach "nearby" trees,
     and to move between "islands".=======
 -  graph distances as a function of the posterior LOD score of the events.

 -  IDEA #1: simulate P(Y|T,tau) as \prod P(Y[i][j]|T,tau)^n[i][j]
            where n[i][j] = 1/2**(D(i,j)-1) 
            wjere D(i,j) is the number of edges between nodes i and j.

 -  IDEA #2: Determine points C[i] as centers for n bins of a distribution.
            + bin boundaries will be at sqrt(C[i]*C{i+1]).
            + define f(x) = C[i] if x is in the i-th bin.
            + then we 
              - constrain E X = 1 under f(x).
              - minimize E |log(X) - log(f(X))|

	    + this will give us bins optimally spaced on the log scale.

    (Note: If the transform function is the quantile function, instead of the
     log function, then we regain the current standard behavior! :)

 - If we look at posterior rate distributions, then we will want to know
   how the rates are distributed spatially.  (This might explain why the
   shape of the rate distribution varies between proteins.)

   How much of the rate distribution can be explained by e.g. exposure
   to solvent?

   If we add alpha/beta/loop notation to each of the internal node residues,
   then this might help us get more realistic rates, as well as indel
   hot and cold spots.

 - How do indel hot and cold spots map to interior/exterior of 3D structure?

 - Can we label each residue with the probability that it will accept deletion?
   Can we label proposed indels with a relative probability of occurrence?
   (Invariant residues/blocks are easier, because they are never inserted.)
   Can we handle a model with both unequal proposals and acceptance rates?

 - If the invariant sites vary over time, we might achieve some fairly interesting
   decoupling of change from linear time.  If sites become invariant during some
   period of time, then they might change fairly little over a rather long time.
   If some sites become variable, then they might change a lot over a fairly short
   time.  If sites change their invariancy in blocks... then we could have an 
   interesting interaction of changes in selection and fitness effects over the
   tree.

 - Can we estimate selection pressure over the tree?  
   We could integrate out the parts we don't know.

 - Can we separate the alphabet/frequency model from the exchangeability
   model for substitution models?

   * This way, YangM0 doesn't have an HKY::f parameter.
   * This way, the *::f parameter is handled much more naturally.
   * This way, we can handle frequency parameters as parameters.
   * This way, we don't have a fixed *::f parameter, unless we need it.
   * This way, we can have more interesting codon frequency models.

 - If we have both coding and non-coding DNA from an organism (hopefully
   from a number of genes, and, I suppose, non-coding regions), then we
   could actually fit a model that determined the frequency of codons from
   the competing pressure of nucleotide and amino acide forces.

   Actually, we might need three different components:

   a) nucleotide mutation pressure
   b) nucleotide content selection pressure
   c) amino acid selection pressure

   Might only amino acid content change between genes?  In that case, we might
   be able to estiamte all the factors using only coding regions!

-  Model RNA as a sequence with variable equilibrium distributions...
   There are only 2^4 = 16 rate classes if everything is 0/1.
   Entropy???     

-  Site-dependent equilibrium frequencies:
  + Question: does entropy of frequencies affect branch lengths?
  + Combine saturation with (site-dependent) rate-change across the tree ?
  + Check effect of non-equivalent equilbrium frequencies.

- Quick ways to score gaps: tell Jeff.
   + Push gaps as high as possible in each column.
   + No nested gaps
   + Linear gaps

- Don't show SRQ or sum plots for partitions w/ less than <N=10> regenerations,
     a) But, perhaps the real issue is generating a confidence band for SRQ plots
     b) Develop an idea of how to do a statistical test based on SRQ plots...
        [ Find the worst sub-section - the flattest line that is longest ]
        [ This will give us the worst mixing rate that we can reject ]
